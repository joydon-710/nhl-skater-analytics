This model is well-suited for:\n\nHandling correlated predictors\nCapturing threshold effects\nRanking variable importance\n\nThe outcome variable is the Special Teams Versatility Score (STVS), defined as:\n[ = Z() + Z()]\nwhere each component is standardized across players.",

    "text": "2 Motivation and Context\nIn modern hockey analytics, traditional statistics such as goals and assists are often insufficient to fully capture a player’s impact. Advanced metrics like expected goals for (xGF) and expected goals against (xGA) provide a probabilistic assessment of scoring chances based on shot quality, location, and game context. When these metrics are evaluated after player shifts, they offer insight into how effectively a player contributes to offensive pressure while limiting defensive risk.\nBy analyzing expected goals on a per-shift basis, this study seeks to answer whether players who consistently finish shifts with a positive expected goal differential can be identified as more efficient or impactful contributors. Such insights are valuable for coaching decisions, player evaluation, and roster optimization.",

A subset of players consistently demonstrates positive shift efficiency, reflecting stronger offensive impact and/or defensive reliability during shifts. Conversely, players with negative efficiency values may be associated with greater defensive exposure or reduced offensive effectiveness.\nThese findings support the usefulness of shift-based expected goal metrics as an evaluative tool, complementing traditional performance statistics. While shift efficiency alone does not capture all dimensions of player value, it provides a concise and interpretable measure of per-opportunity impact.",
