# Welcome

This website presents the full analysis of the **STAT 515 Final Project**, focused on advanced analytics for NHL skater performance using the dataset located at:

**`D:/GMU homeworks/STAT515/final proj/skaters.csv`**

This website contains:

- Data exploration  
- Preprocessing steps  
- Visual analytics  
- Three research questions  
- Statistical and ML modeling  
- Results, interpretation, and conclusion

## Project Objectives

1. Understand and preprocess the NHL skater dataset.  
2. Conduct exploratory and statistical analysis.  
3. Address three predictive analytics research questions:  
   - **RQ1:** How does on-ice performance vary across NHL skaters when measured using advanced performance metrics? 
   - **RQ2:** Which players are likely to demonstrate higher versatility on special teams, as measured by combined Power Play and Penalty Kill performance metrics?  
   - **RQ3:** Which performance metrics most effectively distinguish high-impact skaters from low-impact skaters?” 
4. Build predictive models.  
5. Interpret results and derive insights.
