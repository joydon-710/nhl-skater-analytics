Results show that:\n\n- Players with higher shift efficiency consistently demonstrated stronger two-way play.\n- High-efficiency players were not always those with the highest total ice time, indicating that **quality of shifts matters more than quantity**.\n- A diminishing returns pattern was observed, where increases in shifts beyond a threshold provided marginal efficiency gains.\n\nThis suggests that coaches may benefit from optimizing shift usage rather than maximizing player ice time.\n\n---\n\n## RQ2: Special Teams Versatility Results\n\nThe second research question examined player versatility in **power play and penalty kill situations**. Findings indicate that:\n\n- A subset of players contributes meaningfully in both special teams roles.\n- These versatile players tend to have higher overall expected goal impact.\n- Special teams effectiveness is strongly associated with team-level success metrics.\n\nThis highlights the importance of developing multi-role players who can adapt to different in-game situations.\n\n---\n\n## RQ3: On-Ice vs Off-Ice Impact Results\n\nThe third research question focused on isolating player impact using on-ice versus off-ice metrics. Key results include:\n\n- Significant differences between on-ice and off-ice expected goal differentials for top-performing players.\n- Certain players demonstrated a strong positive impact even when controlling for team strength.\n- These impact deltas provide a more accurate representation of individual contribution than raw scoring statistics.\n\nThis reinforces the value of advanced on/off analytics in modern hockey evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nThe results of this analysis offer several practical implications:\n\n- Coaches can optimize line combinations using efficiency metrics.\n- Front offices can identify undervalued players using on/off impact measures.\n- Analysts can move beyond traditional statistics to more predictive performance indicators.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile informative, this study has several limitations:\n\n- The dataset does not account for player injuries or opposition strength.\n- Shift context (zone starts, matchups) is not fully captured.\n- The analysis is limited to a single season snapshot.\n\nThese limitations provide opportunities for further refinement.\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Results & Discussion\n\nThis section synthesizes findings from all three research questions and interprets the statistical and analytical results in the context of NHL skater performance.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Findings\n\nAcross all analyses, the results highlight that player value cannot be captured by a single metric such as total goals or ice time.
