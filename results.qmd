# Results & Discussion

This section synthesizes findings from all three research questions and interprets the statistical and analytical results in the context of NHL skater performance.

---

## Summary of Key Findings

Across all analyses, the results highlight that player value cannot be captured by a single metric such as total goals or ice time. Instead, advanced analytics such as expected goals, shift efficiency, and on-ice impact provide deeper insight into player contributions.

---

## RQ1: Shift Efficiency Results

The first research question analyzed **shift efficiency**, defined as the difference between expected goals for and against per shift. Results show that:

- Players with higher shift efficiency consistently demonstrated stronger two-way play.
- High-efficiency players were not always those with the highest total ice time, indicating that **quality of shifts matters more than quantity**.
- A diminishing returns pattern was observed, where increases in shifts beyond a threshold provided marginal efficiency gains.

This suggests that coaches may benefit from optimizing shift usage rather than maximizing player ice time.

## RQ2: Special Teams Versatility Results

The second research question examined player versatility in **power play and penalty kill situations**. Findings indicate that:

- A subset of players contributes meaningfully in both special teams roles.
- These versatile players tend to have higher overall expected goal impact.
- Special teams effectiveness is strongly associated with team-level success metrics.

This highlights the importance of developing multi-role players who can adapt to different in-game situations.

## RQ3: On-Ice vs Off-Ice Impact Results

The third research question focused on isolating player impact using on-ice versus off-ice metrics. Key results include:

- Significant differences between on-ice and off-ice expected goal differentials for top-performing players.
- Certain players demonstrated a strong positive impact even when controlling for team strength.
- These impact deltas provide a more accurate representation of individual contribution than raw scoring statistics.

This reinforces the value of advanced on/off analytics in modern hockey evaluation.

## Practical Implications

The results of this analysis offer several practical implications:

- Coaches can optimize line combinations using efficiency metrics.
- Front offices can identify undervalued players using on/off impact measures.
- Analysts can move beyond traditional statistics to more predictive performance indicators.

---

## Limitations

While informative, this study has several limitations:

- The dataset does not account for player injuries or opposition strength.
- Shift context (zone starts, matchups) is not fully captured.
- The analysis is limited to a single season snapshot.

These limitations provide opportunities for further refinement.
